# RL_Quadrotor_Velocity_Control
Using reinforcement learning algorithm TD3 from Parl to solve quadrotor velocity control based on RLSchool environment.

[RLSchool](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/RLSchool) is a group of reinforcement learning simulation environmentsã€‚


This repository includes the user-friendly jupyter notebook version of the solution.
The code is written using [PaddlePaddle](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle). The TD3 algorithm from [PARL](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PARL) is used. 

After training for 1000 episodes, an average score of -20 is achieved and being stable.
